589,"You know, you got a reputation",1,2,46 Long
590,for immaturity...,1,2,46 Long
591,"...and it's not helping, not paying",1,2,46 Long
592,the tributes the acting boss demands.,1,2,46 Long
593,"Acting boss, my ass.",1,2,46 Long

646,Then why is that car inside there?,1,2,46 Long
647,That Dodge?,1,2,46 Long
648,Why is that motherfucker wearing the,1,2,46 Long
649,fucking plate number I had all week?,1,2,46 Long
650,I don't know.,1,2,46 Long
651,Here's what's gonna happen.,1,2,46 Long
652,The two of youse are climbing over that,1,2,46 Long
653,fence and shagging those plates.,1,2,46 Long
654,But the razor wire.,1,2,46 Long
655,Then one of you stays with us while,1,2,46 Long
656,the other goes and gets another Saturn.,1,2,46 Long
657,On the lookout for ducks?,1,2,46 Long
658,Know the old man pretty good.,1,2,46 Long
659,Don't look so sad. Remember how,1,2,46 Long
660,pissed you were about the pool filter?,1,2,46 Long
661,"They were special, them coming here,",1,2,46 Long
662,huh? Don't you think?,1,2,46 Long
663,I wasn't into it.,1,2,46 Long
664,What time's Grandma getting here?,1,2,46 Long
665,She had to drive,1,2,46 Long
666,Fanny to the doctor's.,1,2,46 Long
667,Then she is picking up my parents,1,2,46 Long
668,and they're coming here.,1,2,46 Long
669,They're each bringing,1,2,46 Long
670,some antipasto.,1,2,46 Long
671,"I complain about my mother,",1,2,46 Long
672,about how she just sits at home...,1,2,46 Long
673,...and feels sorry for herself.,1,2,46 Long
674,But she's always ready to drive those,1,2,46 Long
675,friends of hers that can't drive.,1,2,46 Long
676,I'm proud of her. It gives me hope.,1,2,46 Long
677,It's getting chilly out here.,1,2,46 Long
678,Make plenty of noise,1,2,46 Long
679,before you open the front door.,1,2,46 Long
680,You never know who's in there.,1,2,46 Long
681,There's my Star-Ledger. Thanks.,1,2,46 Long
682,"Oh, this street,",1,2,46 Long
683,another pain in the ass.,1,2,46 Long
684,She broke her wrist,1,2,46 Long
685,on the steering column.,1,2,46 Long
686,A minor concussion.,1,2,46 Long
687,What about the other woman?,1,2,46 Long
688,Hip.,1,2,46 Long
689,We were at the hospital till 2 a.m...,1,2,46 Long
690,...talking to her doctor,1,2,46 Long
691,and the staff gerontoligist.,1,2,46 Long
692,They say she shouldn't,1,2,46 Long
693,live alone anymore.,1,2,46 Long
694,She can't manage the telephone.,1,2,46 Long
695,Yet you say she's healthy and alert.,1,2,46 Long
696,Like a bull.,1,2,46 Long
697,Why?,1,2,46 Long
698,I'm just thinking.,1,2,46 Long
699,"I know there are other doctors there,",1,2,46 Long
700,but you know from your own life...,1,2,46 Long
701,...that depression can cause,1,2,46 Long
702,"accidents, poor performance or worse.",1,2,46 Long
703,"So, what are you saying?",1,2,46 Long
704,Unconsciously she tried,1,2,46 Long
705,to whack her friend?,1,2,46 Long
706,It's interesting that you would even,1,2,46 Long
707,take that from what I said.,1,2,46 Long
708,"Either way, she could need a change",1,2,46 Long
709,in her living situation...,1,2,46 Long
710,...be around more people.,1,2,46 Long
711,We were looking at Green Grove.,1,2,46 Long
712,It's a beautiful facility.,1,2,46 Long
713,It's more like a hotel,1,2,46 Long
714,at Cap d'Antibes.,1,2,46 Long
715,Yeah.,1,2,46 Long
716,But to her it's a nursing home.,1,2,46 Long
717,She needs to see the distinction.,1,2,46 Long
718,"That, in fact, she's embarking",1,2,46 Long
719,on a rewarding chapter.,1,2,46 Long
720,I know seniors who are inspired,1,2,46 Long
721,and inspiring.,1,2,46 Long
722,"You're not forgetting us, buddy?",1,2,46 Long
723,Ladies.,1,2,46 Long
724,"Hey, Kenny Portugal said",1,2,46 Long
725,to say hello.,1,2,46 Long
726,"Oh, yeah. Kenny.",1,2,46 Long
727,The fuck is with this cocksucker?,1,2,46 Long
728,"Back up! Mr. Scorsese, good evening.",1,2,46 Long
729,Whoa! Wow!,1,2,46 Long
730,Marty!,1,2,46 Long
731,Kundun! I liked it.,1,2,46 Long
732,So my boy at Comley...,1,2,46 Long
733,...said there's a load,1,2,46 Long
734,of Italian suits.,1,2,46 Long
735,Those unload fast.,1,2,46 Long
736,Mario'll take the whole load.,1,2,46 Long
737,He says shipment moves,1,2,46 Long
738,Thursday at 6 a.m.,1,2,46 Long
739,Give me one good reason,1,2,46 Long
740,I should not jack this truck.,1,2,46 Long
741,It's Junior's own fault. He gives us,1,2,46 Long
742,no choice except to do it again.,1,2,46 Long
743,Taking that outrageous tribute.,1,2,46 Long
744,"He shits on our heads, we're",1,2,46 Long
745,supposed to say thanks for the hat.,1,2,46 Long
746,I'm getting nowhere playing,1,2,46 Long
747,by the rules. Fuck Tony.,1,2,46 Long
748,"""The books are closed."" Blow me.",1,2,46 Long
749,That's some true shit.,1,2,46 Long
750,They're not confirming any,1,2,46 Long
751,new made guys. How come?,1,2,46 Long
752,Fucking chaos. Nobody knows,1,2,46 Long
753,who's running things anymore.,1,2,46 Long
754,Guys don't know who to make payments,1,2,46 Long
755,up the ladder to in some cases.,1,2,46 Long
756,I'm talking about the year 2000.,1,2,46 Long
757,The millennium.,1,2,46 Long
758,Where do we go from here?,1,2,46 Long
759,Oh.,1,2,46 Long
760,"Ma, this Virginia ham...",1,2,46 Long
761,"Go on, get yourself some more.",1,2,46 Long
762,"No, I'm full.",1,2,46 Long
763,"It's good, though.",1,2,46 Long
764,You never let me feed you.,1,2,46 Long
765,So getting back,1,2,46 Long
766,to what we were talking about.,1,2,46 Long
767,You want that lamp?,1,2,46 Long
768,Lie down.,1,2,46 Long
769,"That lamp, that's real ormolu. You",1,2,46 Long
770,know what that's worth when it's new?,1,2,46 Long
771,"We're fixed good lamp-wise, thank you.",1,2,46 Long
772,Take it and take the Barcalounger.,1,2,46 Long
773,Somebody's gotta take,1,2,46 Long
774,this stuff before I die.,1,2,46 Long
775,Otherwise there's gonna be,1,2,46 Long
776,a lot of stuff here...,1,2,46 Long
777,...that the junkman's gonna,1,2,46 Long
778,have to cart off to the dump.,1,2,46 Long
779,"Mom, you're not gonna die. Your",1,2,46 Long
780,stuff won't be hauled off to the dump.,1,2,46 Long
781,Plan for the future. The most rewarding,1,2,46 Long
782,chapter of your life's coming up.,1,2,46 Long
783,You know my good jewelry?,1,2,46 Long
784,The stuff Dad gave you.,1,2,46 Long
785,Some of those pieces came right,1,2,46 Long
786,out of Cartier's window.,1,2,46 Long
787,"Listen, Carm doesn't want it.",1,2,46 Long
788,Not now.,1,2,46 Long
789,We want you to live long and wear your,1,2,46 Long
790,sparklers to grandkids' graduations.,1,2,46 Long
791,I gave it all,1,2,46 Long
792,to your cousin Josephine.,1,2,46 Long
793,The fuck?,1,2,46 Long
794,The good jewelry?,1,2,46 Long
795,She always admired it.,1,2,46 Long
796,They don't have much.,1,2,46 Long
797,"You gave her Cartier rings,",1,2,46 Long
798,and you give me a vibrating chair?,1,2,46 Long
799,Your wife never showed,1,2,46 Long
800,any interest in my jewels.,1,2,46 Long
801,She never complimented me,1,2,46 Long
802,"on any of it, as I remember.",1,2,46 Long
803,Before you do more damage to yourself,1,2,46 Long
804,or your grandchildrens' inheritance...,1,2,46 Long
805,...you'll stop living alone.,1,2,46 Long
806,I'm not going to that nursing home.,1,2,46 Long
807,Green Grove is a retirement community!,1,2,46 Long
808,It's like a hotel at Captain Teeb's!,1,2,46 Long
809,Who's he?,1,2,46 Long
810,A captain who owns luxury hotels,1,2,46 Long
811,or something.,1,2,46 Long
812,"I talked to Mrs. DiCaprio, and she's",1,2,46 Long
813,got a corner suite available.,1,2,46 Long
814,It's available. It'll go fast.,1,2,46 Long
815,Of course it's available.,1,2,46 Long
816,Somebody died!,1,2,46 Long
817,You gotta stop with this black poison,1,2,46 Long
818,cloud all the time. I can't take it!,1,2,46 Long
819,"Oh, poor you!",1,2,46 Long
820,"I got problems at work,",1,2,46 Long
821,problems at home.,1,2,46 Long
822,I got a friend diagnosed with cancer.,1,2,46 Long
823,Most parents would be grateful,1,2,46 Long
824,if their children did this!,1,2,46 Long
825,I'm not going to that place.,1,2,46 Long
826,I will go to court and get power,1,2,46 Long
827,of attorney and place you there.,1,2,46 Long
828,Then kill me now.,1,2,46 Long
829,"Go on, go into the ham...",1,2,46 Long
830,...and take the carving knife,1,2,46 Long
831,and stab me here.,1,2,46 Long
832,"Here! Now please, it would hurt me",1,2,46 Long
833,less than what you just said.,1,2,46 Long
834,I know seniors that are inspired!,1,2,46 Long
835,"Yo, money, we said we'd meet out",1,2,46 Long
836,"front, and you're not even dressed!",1,2,46 Long

449,I felt sorry for him.,6,18,Kennedy and Heidi
